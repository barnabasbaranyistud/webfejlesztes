                <p class="contents">Mirage is the signature map of Counter-Strike games. It was created in 2013, and since then, it has become the main map of the game. Anyone who plays CS knows mirage, it's just simply that iconic. In Counter-Strike 2 the map has gotten a visual overhaul, making the map especially beautiful. If you play the game you know the most important spots on the map: Mid, A site and B site. <br>
                <span class="bold">Fun Fact:</span> If you're rushing B you have to break the TV on the way. You just have to. Unwritten rule.</p>

                <p class="contents">Oh, Inferno or de_inferno... The map codes in Counter-Strike all start with the de_ tag. Why? I never knew. Anyways, Inferno's got a new look with the release of Counter-Strike 2, the map itself is the same but now the textures and italian aspects of the map are brand new. This map has 2 bombsites, the same as all of the competitive maps in CS, and it's known for it's early encounters at mid and banana between the T-s and CT-s.<br>
                <span class="bold">Fun Fact:</span> The road leading to bombsite B is called banana, because someone thought it had the shape of a banana.</p>

                <p class="contents">Dust 2 is the third really famous map of Counter-Strike games. The map is recognised by some as amazing, and by some as terrible nowadays, but still a lot of players opt to play on the map. The map is pretty CT-sided, since the B bombsite is really hard to attack. The map used to be infamous for the early mid encounters, but now it has been changed and it's a little less dangerous for the CT side.<br>
                <span class="bold">Fun Fact:</span> You can find a lot of cheaters on this map, it's their natural habitat.</p>

                <h2 class="article_h">Nuke</h2>
                <p class="contents">Nuke is a little different than the previously mentioned three maps, because it wasn't always in the competitive map pool. However, it still provides a great gameplay experience ever since the early Counter-Strike versions. The map is exciting to play, beacuse of it's unique layout, it has the two bombsites underneath each other.<br>
                <span class="bold">Fun Fact:</span> The map in it's early patches had so many CT boosts (really strong positions), that it needed more than three big map changes.</p>
