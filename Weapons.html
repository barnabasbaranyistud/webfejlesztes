            <h2 class="article_h">The T-side and CT-side</h2>
            <p class="contents">Counter-Strike 2 is a 5v5 shooter game, as the predecessors have been. The players compete on maps, and they play half of the rounds on the CT-side and the remaining ones on the T-side.
            This is important, because there are different weapons for each side, and it reshapes the playstyle of players. Before CS2, the T-side
            weapons were always better, because they only needed one headshot to kill. However, now in CS2 the game feels less responsive, and because of this the AK-47 spray was deemed much worse by players, and the CT-side is much preferred today, because of the weapons, and the defending side too.</p>

            <h2 class="article_h">No More Weapon Wheel</h2>
            <p class="contents">In Counter-Strike when you're in the game you can access your weapons using the weapon wheel, or at least you could. Before, you could choose any weapon from your side, but now you can only choose a handful of weapons to equip and be able to utilize throught competitive games. There is a new quality of life upgrade with CS2 as well, since now you can sell your weapons in the buy phase.The new UI looks much better than the old one, but the traditional one will always be remembered by Counter-Strike veterans.</p>

            <h2 class="article_h">Grenades and utility</h2>
            <p class="contents">There are not only weapons you can use during battle, the game gives you options for armor, utility and close range combat as well. Armor (Kevlar) is always recommended to be bought during every gun round, because it offers approx. 33% damage reduction. You can buy a helmet as well, which can give you extra durability too.<br>
            Utility, I would say, is the most important in the whole game. It makes the game much more difficult and interesting, as the players don't just rely on shooting skills, but they need advanced strategic skills as well to be able to smoke, flash, nade or molly enemies, to make their lifes easier and opponents' harder.
